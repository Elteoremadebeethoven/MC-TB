# Manim-community
## Format

This is the repository where the code created by the community is published, the most basic format for sharing your code is shown in Animations/Orbit/orbit.py. At the beginning of the code the following mandatory format must be added:

```python
"""
Author:         
Date:           
Last update:    
Contact*:       
OS:             
Files*:         
Results:        
"""
```

> Author
GitHub username.

> Date:
Creation date.

> Last update:
If the code is already added to the repository and you want to improve it, here it goes the date of the last modification.

> Contact (Optional):
Email, reddit username, etc.

> OS:
Operating system (specified), Windows 10, Mac Sierra, Linux Fedora 30, etc.

> Files (optional):
If the code needs audio, svg, images or some file you must list them, including the format.

> Results:
Link to the gif, video or image.

You can add an .md file in case you want to explain more the code, as you can see in orbits/
Even if you only add one file, you should always place it in a folder.
All the code must to be in one file, and it must be in english.

# Recommendations

You can use flake8 to make the code more readable, in addition to adding the necessary comments.
